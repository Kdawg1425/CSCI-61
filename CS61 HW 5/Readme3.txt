Problem 1
- Recursive code to calculate x number of binary trees for x amount of nodes
- Cataln Numbers is the algorithm.

Problem 2
- Worked as a group to figure out
- Takes in prefix expression and changes it to postfix to make it easier
  to put into a binary tree
- Put in binary tree
- Then prints out binary tree

Problem 3
- Added the function that was required to add
- Tried fixing the other files that were supplied to us for our code to be tested and
  run. Difference in compiler caused for a lot of errors to occur.
- Compared code with others that had their compiler able to run given files and
  confirm that my code works.
